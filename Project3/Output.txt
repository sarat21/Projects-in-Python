Problem 2:
Type of data in x_ar:  float64
Type of data in y_ar:  float64
Type of data in v_ar:  float64
For x_ar, Mean =  129.565003539 and Standard Deviation =  103.18231825
For y_ar, Mean =  271.318 and Standard Deviation =  150.830026297
For v_ar, Mean =  25.8599784753 and Standard Deviation =  14.9348149299
